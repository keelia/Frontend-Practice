# Implement CSS inline block layout by JaveScript

## Two Containers
1. A div-element as container which has inline-block-div-element with CSS rules, for comparing.
2. A canvas-element as container which has painted-inline-block elements which CSS rules are implemented by JS

## Inline-block Element
CSS Rules:
   - Border width(default 1px)/Color
   - Color
   - Background color
   - Width(px)
   - Height(px)
   - Text content
   - Vertical align(Top/Bottom only)
   - Margin
   - Padding(To be supported)
  

## To Achieve
1. Each inline-block element with CSS rules should be rendered in containers 
2. Each inline-block element in canvas-container should be rendered exactly same as in div-container, on matter the page first loaded , window resize, insert or remove inline-block element
